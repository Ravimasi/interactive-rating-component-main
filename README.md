### What I learned

I learned alot in this project that i tought it would be quite easy to develop, first of all, that was my first time messing with forms and how to manipulate them, of course not that deep but still.

Something that i also enjoyed alot was playing with localStorage ( the pros and cons ) and the window methods, for example :

```js
window.location.href = `thank-you.html?rating=${ratingValue} // It redirects me to the thank-you.html page
```

And believe it or not, CSS! Obviously i don't love it all the time but it is very very cool to "assemble" your site and comparing it bit by bit to the project that you're given.

### Continued development

Something that got stuck in my mind is to validate the form and don't let the user be able to Submit if the rating is not chosen.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/) - As always, this site ALWAYS helps me.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/how-to-use-localstorage-with-javascript/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand localStorage in my first try. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

Asking ChatGPT when i got stuck really saved me some time because i found some very antique webposts, like 9~10 years old.
